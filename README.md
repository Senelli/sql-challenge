## Data Analysis 
- queried to get the tables containing the information listed below:
    - Lists the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee 
    - Lists the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986 
    - Lists the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name 
    - Lists the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name 
    - Lists first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B 
    - Lists each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name 
    - Lists each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name 
    - Lists the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)
